To github.com:caleighG/git-lab.git                                                                 
  ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)                                                   
  error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:caleighG/git-lab.git'                          
  hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do                          
  hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing                      
  hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes                         
  hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.                                                
  hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
